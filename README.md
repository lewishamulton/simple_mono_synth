# General Information 

## Mono Synth 
This is a simple mono synth built using the JUCE framework and is based off a tutorial from the Audio Programmer. The synth uses various dsp algorithms, both inbuilt JUCE ones such as the oscillator and manually-coded ones such as an oscillator within the oscillator for simple FM synthesis. 

It builds upon the tutorial by introducing a second oscillator in unison to the first and allows for the re-pitching of each- allowing users to play intervals. Mono synth also includes an FX section with a digital delay and distortion to colour the sound more. 

The UI is intentionally minimalist as I think it prevents 'options paralysis' often found when opening a VST with lots of params but it still does enough paramters to create unique sounds with. 

Feel free to download and add to it, and I want to continue adding and improving it in the coming months.

## Downloading

If you download a copy of JUCE (https://juce.com/) and the source code then you can compile the code yourself locally and use it in any DAW (**however** I've only tested the mono synth in Ableton Live). Due to the version of JUCE framework I'm using I can't compile/distribute binaries of the software.
